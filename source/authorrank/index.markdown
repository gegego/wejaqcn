This project is to learn about analysing big data by hadoop map reduce framework. The research data set is [Microsoft Academic Graph](http://aka.ms/academicgraph). I will try to implement a method to compute ranking of authors of paper based on Google's pagerank algorithm.

[**Documentation**](/images/authorrank.pdf) includes more contents about the idea, mehtod and result of the project. And [**HERE**](https://github.com/gegego/AuthorRank) is souce code of the implementation by java.
