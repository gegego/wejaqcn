This project is the final thesis research work. We design a numeric feature(Fourier Analysis) of oil painting and make classification of their artists. Basiclly, it is texture pattern anaylsis problem because the oil pattern brushstroke is a kind of texture pattern and has very high personal stylies of their artists.

[**Documentation**](https://github.com/gegego/paclas/blob/master/thesis.pdf) includes everything about the ideas, methods and results of the project. And [**HERE**](https://github.com/gegego/paclas) is souce code of the implementation by c++, opencv and QT.
